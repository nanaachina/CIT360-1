# CIT 360 Professional Behavior

1. Interacting professionally with the instructor
	I believe that my interactions with the professor have been professional and above board, limited though they may have been.
2. Interacting helpfully and professionally with people outside your team.
	I made it a point to try and participate in the developer forums to try and help anyone that I could with my own limited experience and skillset. I feel that I may have helped people.
3. Interacting professionally within your team
	I met with our team weekly and did my best to work as a team. I was assigned a great team and learned a lot from working with them. We always had cordial discussions and discussed not only the needs of this class, but also other classes that people were taking and issues of personal life such as the risks involved with purchasing an electric car that one member was considering and how another member's job interviews were going. We were all in constant contact via a Slack channel that was established for the group. This made communication much easier than relying exclusively on email or the BYUI communications portal.
4. Self-reflection/Meta-cognition
	This is the second time that I have tried to take this course. I was overwhelmed the first time that I tried it and the course's format of familiarity reviews still doesn't sit squarely in my wheelhouse, but I have tried to meet all of the course requirements this time around and do better with the familiarity reviews and all other course activities.
	I would be lying to say that I haven't struggled with this course a great deal. The format still seems alien to me, but I will improvise, adapt, and overcome to the best of my abilities.
5. Team's agile methodology
	Our team's agile method was agile.
